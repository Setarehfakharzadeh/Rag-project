## 🤖 About the Project
# RAG Chat Interface

A sophisticated chat interface implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a large language model for enhanced conversational AI capabilities.

## 🤖 About the Project

This project combines a modern React frontend with a Flask backend to create an intelligent chat interface powered by the StableBeluga-7B language model. The system uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to provide more accurate and context-aware responses.

### Key Features

- **Large Language Model Integration**: Utilizes StableBeluga-7B (4GB quantized model) for generating responses
- **RAG Implementation**: Enhanced response generation with context retrieval
- **Modern Tech Stack**: React frontend with TypeScript + Flask backend
- **Real-time Chat Interface**: Responsive and user-friendly design
- **DevContainer Support**: Easy development environment setup

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- Modern CSS for styling
- Real-time communication with backend

### Backend
- Flask (Python)
- StableBeluga-7B Language Model
- RAG implementation for context-aware responses

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- 8GB+ RAM recommended

### Language Model Setup
Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the language model file (`stablebeluga-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf`) is not included in this repository. To use this project:

1. Download the model:
   ```bash
   # Download from Hugging Face
   wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/StableBeluga-7B-GGUF/resolve/main/stablebeluga-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf
   ```

2. Place the downloaded file in the project root directory.

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## 🚀 Running the Application

### Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```
The backend will start on http://localhost:5001

### Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000

## 🧪 Testing

### Frontend Tests
The frontend includes comprehensive test coverage using Jest and React Testing Library:

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests without watch mode
npm test -- --watchAll=false

# Or use the provided script
./run-tests.sh
```

The frontend tests cover:
- Component rendering
- User interactions (typing, clicking buttons)
- API integration
- Error handling

### Backend Tests
```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/
```
